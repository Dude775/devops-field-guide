## Learning Path

### 1. HTML - In Progress ✅

**Course**: SoloLearn HTML
**Status**: In Progress
**Current Progress**: Lesson 2 completed

#### Lesson 1: The Core Web Technology

**Key Points:**
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages
- HTML describes the structure and content of a web page
- HTML consists of elements represented by tags
- Browsers interpret HTML to display formatted content
- HTML works alongside CSS (styling) and JavaScript (interactivity) as core web technologies

#### Lesson 2: HTML Code

**Key Points:**
- HTML documents have a defined structure with essential elements
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type
- The `<html>` element is the root of an HTML page
- The `<head>` contains meta information about the document
- The `<body>` contains the visible page content
- HTML tags usually come in pairs: opening tag `<tag>` and closing tag `</tag>`

**Code Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
