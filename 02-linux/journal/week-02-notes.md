# Week 02 - Linux Environment Setup

> *Guiding questions for reflection. Fill in after the lab.*

## What was the first real "Linux moment"?

<!-- The moment it stopped being abstract and became real - maybe when curl wasn't installed, or when the terminal was all you had -->

## How did SSH change the workflow?

<!-- Compare working in the VirtualBox console vs SSH from PowerShell. What became possible? -->

## What commands felt natural vs foreign?

<!-- Which commands clicked immediately? Which ones required looking up syntax? -->

## Connection to DevOps

<!-- Managing remote servers starts here. How does this lab connect to what was covered in Module 01 about production environments? -->

## Surprises

<!-- Anything unexpected - password not showing, packages not pre-installed, network behavior, etc. -->
